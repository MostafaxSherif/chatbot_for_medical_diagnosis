Chatbot for medical Diagnosis using LLaMA model and NLP (Naturel Language Process)
Dataset: 
- Utilized medical textbooks and pdfs containing information about the specified deceases, symptoms and 
treatment.
Implementation:
- Embeddings: I use it in Transformation text in PDF files into vector format to store it in data store.
- LLMs: an artificial intelligence (AI) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. 
 I used the LLaMa to learn from PDFs about medical diagnosis.
- RAG: I used Retrieval Augmented Generation to enhance language models by allowing them to fetch 
information from PDFs before generating responses.
- Prompt: I used Conversation Starters, Completion Prompts to define how to write the answer and say in the last 
of answer (thank you).
- Streamlit: It allows you to create web applications for data science and machine learning with minimal effort
